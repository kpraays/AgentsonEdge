### plots

There are two kinds of plots.

1. Across the workload when 5 sets of 100 queries each were submitted and plotted. (recorded per half second)
   - Plotted as following:
       - [workload reading vs time axes](./workload/secs/) (As requested)
       - [max values of the readings per query](./workload/sample_points/) (html interactive plots)

2. Granular - when readings were recorded for a single query of each type per 1/100th of a second. (As requested)
    - Plotted one after the other [here](./granular/)
    - Plotted superimposed (one type of query over other) [here](./granular/superimposed/)

3. Number of CPU = 4
    Thread(s) per core:  1
    Core(s) per socket:  4
    Socket(s):           1
